# challenge-1
First challenge for the course
When I view the source code I can see the added semantic HTML elements
When I view the structure of the elements they follow a logical structure. 
I Added accessible alt atributes so when I turned on screen reader, the img and icon descriptions would be read aloud.
Everything seems to fall in sequential order.
Changed the title element name from "Website" to Horiseon Marketing.
